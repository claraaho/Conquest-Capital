				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>Conquest Capital is uniquely positioned as a trusted investment consultant among the emerging wealthy international immigrants of the Vancouver business community. This positioning is based on the companyâ€™s observations of historical investment portfolios:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>legacy investments have largely been in passive assets such as real estate and trust accounts which do not have a broad-based economic multiplier effect for the local economy</li>
				<li>this community is not well organized which creates a leadership void</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conquest Capital has identified a demand among the second generation community for investment opportunities that change the paradigm; investments that generate cash flow from operating income. Cash flow that will directly benefit the local economy and thus create a positive environment for the growth of small businesses, the lifeblood of the Canadian economy.</p>

			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>At Conquest Capital our goal is to improve the competitive landscape of key industries.  We will accomplish this by acting as a financial catalyst for new profitable and innovative companies.  This will provide these organizations  with the capital they need to grow their operations on a grand scale.  By doing this we will create an inventory of new vehicles for accredited and new investors that will not available to the general public.</p>
			<p>While most investment funds focus on one or two asset classes, they do not give the client the ability to diversify their portfolios and personalize it to reach their financial goals. The investment funds that do provide these services such as mutual funds, charge huge fees and routinely invest based on the companies that compensate them for the referral.</p>
			<p>Conversely, Conquest Capital will build an investment platform built on mutual trust.</p>
